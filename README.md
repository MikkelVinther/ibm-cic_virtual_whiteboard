### Role
For the purpose of this project my efforts have been mainly focused on producing the front-end portion of this whiteboard application. 

### Argumentation
This project has been made with React.js. It has been done so for a few reasons.
First of, Javascript is the language i am most comfortable with, as well goes for React for Javascript frameworks.
React is also favorable because of it different handling of the DOM over good, old regular HTML & Javascript, as well does it employ a component based structure, which is potentially better for avoiding redundancy.. potentially..

## Local Installation
As this project was made with react, installation should be as easy as downloading the project files from github, cd'ing to your chosen location for the files and then run npm install there.
