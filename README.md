# ibm-cic_virtual_whiteboard
 This is my virtual whiteboard project for the IBM CIC technical case

## Description
Hello! Welcome to my Virtual Whiteboard project! 

### Role
For the purpose of this project my efforts have been mainly focused on producing the front-end portion of this whiteboard application. 

### Argumentation
This project has been made with React.js. It has been done so for a few reasons.

### Github Pages Deployment
This is hopefully where the URL for my github pages deployment will be! 

## Local Installation
As this project was made with react, installation should be as easy as downloading the project files from github, cd'ing to your chosen location for the files and then run npm install there.
